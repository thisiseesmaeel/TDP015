# TDP015 - Mathematics

Welcome to the website for the course TDP015 Principles of Mathematics and Logic!

This course provides an introduction to different mathematical areas which can be applied within programming and program development. Each area is introduced through a theme, consisting of a or more lecture material. After completing the exercises, you will use the theory you have learned to solve a concrete problem. For each area there is also a small programming task where you can use your theoretical knowledge on something concrete.
